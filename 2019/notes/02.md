# AOC 2019 Day 2

## Part A

This one wasn't bad, I decided to use dictionaries because changing the length of a list was kinda unnecessary.

## Part B

Turns out that with the way the problem is set up, we only need to check the first 10,000 integers, where the noun is the first two digits and the verb is the last two digits. Then it was just a matter of running until the output was what we wanted. 

## Code

```python
from aocd.models import Puzzle
from collections import defaultdict
from itertools import count

puzzle = Puzzle(year = 2019, day = 2)

data = puzzle.input_data
instr = [int(i) for i in data.split(',')]

def part_a():

    instr_a = defaultdict(int)
    for I, N in enumerate(instr):
        instr_a[I]  = N
    instr_a[1] = 12
    instr_a[2] = 2
    idx = 0

    while (opcode:=instr_a[idx]) != 99:
        idx_1 = instr_a[idx+1]
        idx_2 = instr_a[idx+2]
        idx_3 = instr_a[idx+3]

        if opcode == 1:
            instr_a[idx_3] = instr_a[idx_1] + instr_a[idx_2]
        else:
            instr_a[idx_3] = instr_a[idx_1] * instr_a[idx_2]
        idx += 4
    ans = instr_a[0]
    print(ans)
    puzzle.answer_a = ans

def part_b():
    for start_val in count():
        instr_a = defaultdict(int)
        for I, N in enumerate(instr):
            instr_a[I]  = N
        instr_a[1] = start_val//100
        instr_a[2] = start_val % 100
        idx = 0

        while (opcode:=instr_a[idx]) != 99:
            idx_1 = instr_a[idx+1]
            idx_2 = instr_a[idx+2]
            idx_3 = instr_a[idx+3]

            if opcode == 1:
                instr_a[idx_3] = instr_a[idx_1] + instr_a[idx_2]
            else:
                instr_a[idx_3] = instr_a[idx_1] * instr_a[idx_2]
            idx += 4
        if instr_a[0] == 19690720:
            break
    print(start_val)
    puzzle.answer_b = start_val

part_a()
part_b()
