# AOC 2025 Day 1

Happy AOC!!

## Part A

Not too bad for part A, just went right if R, left if L, checked if we reached 0 mod 100. I had a minor hiccup where I started at 0 and not 50, but otherwise not too bad. 

## Part B

This one gave me a minor headache. Initially, I was just checking to see if we passed 0 at all. However, that's not what the problem asks, as sometimes, we would pass 0 multiple times in one turn. This wasn't in the example, just stated as a small line underneath. I just used some integer division math to determine how many times we turn past 0, then if we need an additional 0 because we turn too far. Also, I don't like big numbers, so I ended up doing the position mod 100 at the end. 

## Code

```python
from aocd.models import Puzzle

puzzle = Puzzle(year = 2025, day = 1)

data = puzzle.input_data

def part_a():
    dir = data.split()
    zeros=  0
    pos = 50
    for d in dir:
        if d[0] == "R":
            pos += int(d[1:])
        else:
            pos -= int(d[1:])
        if pos % 100 == 0:
            zeros += 1
        # print(pos)
    print(zeros)
    puzzle.answer_a = zeros
    
def part_b():
    dir = data.split()
    zeros=  0
    pos = 50
    prev_pos = 50
    for d in dir:
        dist = int(d[1:])
        zerosThisTime = 0
        if d[0] == "R":
            pos += dist
            zerosThisTime += (pos-prev_pos) // 100
            if prev_pos + (dist%100) >= 100:
                zerosThisTime += 1
        else:
            pos -= dist
            zerosThisTime += (prev_pos - pos) // 100
            if prev_pos !=0 and prev_pos - (dist%100) <= 0:
                zerosThisTime += 1
        # print(d, prev_pos, pos, zerosThisTime)
        pos %= 100
        prev_pos = pos
        zeros += zerosThisTime
    print(zeros)
    puzzle.answer_b = zeros
