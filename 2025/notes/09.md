# AOC 2025 Day 9

## Part A

Not bad, just had to iterate over all combinations to find the maximum area. I had 2 mistakes that costed me 2 minutes. First, I forgot to add 1 to account for the boundary. Second, I accidentally subtracted one.

## Part B

What a puzzle, man.

First, I would like to say that PriorityQueues were the way to go when it comes to sorting by area. That's the only thing that I did right initially. 

I tried implementations manually checking if each point `(x,y)` was either green or red when I made the rectangles. That was incredibly inefficient.

Then I tried to do intervals, which worked okay-ish.

My final implementation involves the dictionary `y_ints`. The keys are the different y-values, where the values are sets which contain the largest intervals in which there is a stretch of continuous x. As an example, using the example input, `y_ints[2] = {(7,11)}`. 

Then, iterating from maxArea downwards, if for any y, the x bounds were not in one interval, then that rectangle is not "colorful," or containing only red and green points. We keep taking from the PriorityQueue until we find a colorful rectangle, where we print both its area and how many iterations it takes. 

I ended up getting third on my private leaderboard, but I'm still leading my rival [Ryan](https://github.com/R2bEEaton) by at least 11 points, so hopefully I can keep this lead?
