# AdventOfCode
 
This are my (TJ O) solutions to Advent of Code! I have been completing them since 2022, but I wanted to both complete all previous ones as well as centralize them. Below is a table leading to my solutions for each year, as well as how far I've come in each year. As time goes on, I plan to rewrite my solutions for earlier years, as well as complete all future advents in this repo.
