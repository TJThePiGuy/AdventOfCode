# TJ O's Advent of Code 2024

That's right, we're back! It only feels like a few months ago that I was writing a Picross solver in Python, and yet, here we are! I'm competing on the same leaderboard as last year, which is the NJIT ACM leaderboard. Below is the table of my times, as well as my individual thoughts on each puzzle. Hope everyone has an amazing AOC!
