# AOC 2024 Day 18

## Part A

Not bad at all. Just needed a BFS until we reached the end. I had a "off-by-one" error from the example, so I just assumed I'd have the same thing in my regular implementation, which I did. 

## Part B

Also not bad at all. Brute-forcing took time, but not too much that I was concerned. I took a shortcut knowing that the first 1024 were good, so I started by copying that set over, then adding from position 1024 onward. If we were able to reach the end, then we add the next one. Otherwise, that's the one that fails.

While typing this up, I realized there's another (maybe more efficient) way to do it with seeing which byte falling triggers (0,0) and (70,70) to be in two distinct regions of the plane. I think the regular path-finding algorithm's fine, though.

    walls_1024.add(tuple(int(i) for i in line.split(',')))

    walls_list.append(tuple(int(i) for i in line.split(',')))
