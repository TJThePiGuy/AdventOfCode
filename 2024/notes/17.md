# AOC 2024 Day 17

Man, what a day! I've got a final at 8:30, so to get this done by 2 was a relief!

## Part A

This one wasn't bad, just executing code. I expected something to be happening with the one program thing that had a 7 for part B, but I was completely wrong. Just did the same thing I did in 2017 where you execute code based on the op code, storing registers in a fancy way to make my life easier. 

## Part B

So this part had a few complications. 

First, I tried to brute force. Just kept going up, running each number until it didn't match. I only realized much later why this was awful, which is that we're going to be int-dividing by 8 a lot, so why not start at 8 to the sixteenth? No clue. 

Next, I tried going by hand. This was awful, but rereading my input and the problem statement, there were a lot of allusions to working with 3-bit numbers, so maybe my solution can take advantage of that. In addition, I realized that we're int-dividing by     

The final epiphany came when I realized that I shouldn't be iterating from the front, but rather, *from the back*. That is, first, I tested 1-7, checking if the output from those matched the last output. If it did, I added it to a set to check next. From there, I checked the numbers that matched to any number in that set when int-divided by 8. For example, if 7 was in the set, the range 56 to 63 would be checked to see if it matched the next digit. If so, it was added to the set, and so on and so forth.

At first, I hard-coded the instruction to my input, and that definitely worked. I then modified my part A code to a new part B method to run the code until we try outputing, then checked if it matches what it should. All in all, this was a very difficult problem, but very rewarding.
