# AOC 2024 Day 25

Merry Christmas to all those that celebrate!

## Part A

So I got a late start because I was traveling until 1:30 AM, so apologies for being late. This was a fun problem to finish on, though!

First, instead of using the recommended way to use heights, I decieded to just count the number of hashes that appear in each column as the heights, then adding each height to either locks or keys based on if the top row was entirely hashes or not. Using this method, a key and lock overlap iff the sum of the heights in that column exceed 7. `product` from `itertools` made brute-forcing each combination of lock and key really efficient, and just increasing total when the sum of each column of heights was less than 7. 

I was really happy this advent, wspecially since I topped the NJIT leaderboard this year! All of the problems were really fun to do, and I can't wait to go back and finish all the other years. 

## Code

```python
from aocd.models import Puzzle
from itertools import product

puzzle = Puzzle(year = 2024, day = 25)

data = puzzle.input_data

def part_a():

    objs = data.split('\n\n')

    keys = set()
    locks = set()

    for obj in objs:
        lines = obj.split('\n')
        heights = tuple(sum(line[i] == '#' for line in lines) for i in range(5))
        if all(c == '#' for c in lines[0]):
            locks.add(heights)
        else:
            keys.add(heights)
    total = 0
    for k, l in product(keys, locks):
        if all(k[i] + l[i] <= 7 for i in range(5)):
            total += 1
    print(total)
    puzzle.answer_a = total
    
part_a()
