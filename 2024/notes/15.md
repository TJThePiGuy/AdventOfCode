# AOC 2024 Day 15

Shoutouts to Sokoban. 

## Part A

Fun math. I used a recursive check function which, if we try to move into a wall, return False. Otherwise, if it is a box, return if that box can also move in that direction. Otherwise, return True. For recursive movement, it was very similar. We know we can move because I say so, so if the next position is a box, move the box, then return the new position we are at. Very interesting, as this was my first time I had to program any kind of block-pushing. 

## Part B

Less fun math. This one took me a while because I wasn't sure how I wanted to structure my boxes. Initially, I had a set of positions (left, right, y), but I realized that was stupid because right = left+1 always, so I settled on measuring the left side. My recursive check was the same style, but broken up into moving vertically, left, or right. The vertical check had to check both sides for blocks, while the horizontal checks only had to have one. It was a similar case for moving recursively, and the code was pretty much done 40 minutes in. What messed me up the most, however, was the wording of the final part of the problem: 

*"For these larger boxes, distances are measured from the edge of the map to the closest edge of the box in question."* 

I assumed this meant that we're checking the distance *from any edge*, not just the top and left ones. This was wrong, though, and costed me 20 minutes and maybe first place on my private leaderboard. Oh well, you live and you learn, I suppose.
