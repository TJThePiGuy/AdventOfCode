# AOC 2024 Day 22

## Part A

Not bad at all, just implementing an algorithm to get new secret numbers. I expected some sort of hashing for part B because of previous things like the knot hash from 2017, but it wasn't that at all. 

## Part B

A little worse, but still kinda simple. Initially, I decieded to complicate things by trying to brute force every possible set of four differences, but that ran extremely slow.

The next idea was to only iterate over the ones that I've seen, but that was extremely slow as well.

The final answer was probably the simplest, which was that after we compute the sequence and take the differences, get each subsequence of 4 from the diffs. If we haven't seen that subsequence yet, then increase the corresponding amount of bananas gained by the last banana value at the end of the sequence. Then all that was needed was to find the maximum. I'm grateful this one was much quicker than last night. 

## Code

```python
from aocd.models import Puzzle
import numpy as np
from collections import defaultdict

puzzle = Puzzle(day = 22, year = 2024)

data = puzzle.input_data
starts = [int(i) for i in data.split('\n')]

MIX = 16777216

def part_a():
    total = 0
    for s in starts:
        secret = s
        for i in range(2000):
            secret = ((secret * 64) ^ secret) % MIX
            secret = ((secret // 32) ^ secret) % MIX
            secret = ((secret * 2048) ^ secret) % MIX
        total += secret
    print(total)
    puzzle.answer_a = total

nums = {i for i in range(-9,10)}

def part_b():
    bananas = defaultdict(int)
    for s in starts:
        sequence = [s % 10]
        secret = s
        for i in range(2000):
            secret = ((secret * 64) ^ secret) % MIX
            secret = ((secret // 32) ^ secret) % MIX
            secret = ((secret * 2048) ^ secret) % MIX
            sequence.append(secret % 10)
        diffs = np.diff(sequence).tolist()

        in_seq = set()
        for i in range(len(diffs)-4):
            d = tuple(diffs[i:i+4])
            if d in in_seq:
                continue
            in_seq.add(d)
            if len(d) == 4:
                 bananas[d] += sequence[i + 4]
    print(max(bananas.values()))
    puzzle.answer_b = max(bananas.values())
