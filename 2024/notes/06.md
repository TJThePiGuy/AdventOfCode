# AOC 2024 Day 6

## Part A

Honestly, not too bad. It's the usual "turn to not walk into wall" code that I knew. Just added the current points until the points were out of bounds. 

## Part B

Brute forced. It took a while, but it ran and was successful. Foe each new possible point, just had to do a check if it ever entered a loop, which is just being at the same position in the same direction as before. Had a bug that lasted for a few minutes because I wasn't resetting the position every iteration. 

## Code

```python
from aocd.models import Puzzle

puzzle = Puzzle(day = 6, year = 2024)

def part_a():
    data = puzzle.input_data
    hashes = set()
    lines = data.split('\n')
    H = len(lines)
    X = Y = -1
    dir_dict = {0:(-1,0),1:(0,1),2:(1,0),3:(0,-1)}
    for y, line in enumerate(lines):
        W = len(line)
        for x, char in enumerate(line):
            if char == '^':
                X = x
                Y = y
            elif char == '#':
                hashes.add((x,y))
    locs = set()
    dir = 3
    while((X > -1) and (X < W) and (Y > -1) and (Y < H)):
        print(X,Y)
        locs.add((X,Y))
        d = dir_dict[dir]
        dx,dy = d
        next_X = X + dx
        next_Y = Y + dy
        while (next_X,next_Y) in hashes:
            dir -= 1
