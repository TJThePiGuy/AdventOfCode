# AOC 2024 Day 20

*I AM COOKING OUT OF MY MIND*

## Part A

This one was actually kinda interesting. Like yeah, I am sick of the grid puzzles, but being able to cheat is a unique way to solve a maze. I realized quickly that I needed a "distance" function between the end and every other space in the grid, which I did with a Breadth-First Search, increasing the distance as I went. Then, for every point in the grid, for every direction, that we could cheat in, instead we move twice that distance. If the difference between the current distance and the new distance (minus 1) is greater than 100, then we saved 100 picoseconds and count it. 

## Part B

Very unique extension, now cheating up to 20 picoseconds. I realized that all I needed was a way to check the diamond that is within 20 taxicab units of a centerpoint, so I used a loop to create a dict whose keys were the distances and whose values was a set of points that distance away. Then it was just a matter of extending the check to all positions in the diamond, and we subtract the old minus the new distance (minus the distance traveled). If that distance is at least 100, then we count it. I was super satisfied with this one, and ended up 261 globally!
