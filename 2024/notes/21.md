# AOC 2024 Day 21

Holy hell, here's where it got hard.

## Part A

(I had a non-linear-algebra part A, but deleted it because it ran incredibly slow)

My first solution was just brute-forcing every input, caching where I needed to just to optimize. I don't remember it much, but I finished it in an hour, so it's okay, I guess. 

## Part B

Now here's where the fun begins.

I knew immediately that there was a recursive dynamic programming solution, but I couldn't figure out the implementation for the life of me. I worked on an doff on it for most of today.

But right around 4 pm, I had the thought "what if there's some transition matrix jank that can occur?" For example, if we need to input >^, there's some sequence to move from > to ^ (notably, <^). But this sequence starts at A (because the last input started at A) and must end at A (because we need to input that direction), so >^ results in the sequence A<^A, which, if we're only conerned with paris, is (A<),(<^),(^A). Thus, a 25 by 25 matrix was born, whose rows indicate how many of each possible pair of sequences end up when we have a pair corresponding to the column. 

After creating the matrix in Excel ([literally](resources/21_matrix.png)), all that was left to do was exponentiate it. 

This problem was so unique that I despised part B, but enjoyed my solution so much!
