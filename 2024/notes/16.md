# AOC 2024 Day 16

Good luck on finals everyone! I've got one in 7.5 hours

## Part A

This one was kinda fun. I figured using PriorityQueues in Python would make it quicker, and it does. This is just applying Djikstra's Algorithm until we reach the end coordinate. This would guarantee that the path we took is the shortest. This one ran in about a quarter of a second, and I placed second on the leaderboard, which I was happy about. 

## Part B

This one was a bit more of a struggle, but I found a way to save a lot of time by only checking up to and including the maximum length a path could be. In addition, I stored each path as a binary number whose $i$ th digit was 1 if it was part of the path and 0 otherwise. The final logic came from or-ing all best paths with each other and counting the number of ones in the binary representation. This one runs in about 11 seconds, which I'm still impressed that every path with a score below 100,000+ can be checked that quickly. All in all, great problem!
