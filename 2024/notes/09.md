# 2024 AOC Day 9

Damn, day 9 got hands

## Part A

I was so tripped up with how to implement what I wanted that I never stopped to actually implement it. I've got some left-right-index shenanigans going on where I'm decreasing the count for which one I should be using, then moving on when that count is 0. I'm actually pretty happy with the implementation, but definitely not the time.

## Part B

Of course, I had to rewrite this from the ground up. I actually found working with blocks and not individual letters significantly easier. Essentially, iterating backwards, we find the first segment of spaces smaller in length than the current block. If such a space exists, we change the starting index of the block to that index, increment the starting index of the space by the length of the block, and decrease the length of the space by the length of the block. 

## Code
```python

puzzle = Puzzle(day = 9, year = 2024)

    data = puzzle.input_data
    data = [int(i) for i in data]
    counts = data[::2]
    cum_sums = np.cumsum(data)
    take_from_front= True
    pos = 0
    cum_sum_idx = 0
    total = 0
    left_idx = 0
    right_idx = len(data)//2
    while(left_idx <= right_idx):
        if(take_from_front):
            total += pos * left_idx
            counts[left_idx] -= 1
            while(counts[left_idx] == 0):
                left_idx += 1
                if(left_idx >= len(data)//2):
                    break
        else:
            total += pos*right_idx
            counts[right_idx] -= 1
            while(counts[right_idx] == 0):
                right_idx -= 1
                if(right_idx < 0):
                    break
        pos += 1
        while(pos >= cum_sums[cum_sum_idx]):
            cum_sum_idx += 1
