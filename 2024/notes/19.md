# AOC 2024 Day 19

## Part A

Absolutely programming out of my mind. Looking back on it, this is so inefficient, but it works. Basically, we can initially reach index 0 in each design. From there, we pop any indices we can reach, and check every towel. If that towel pattern matches at the current index, we know we can reach the current index plus the length. Finally, just check if the length of the towel is in the `reachable` set we've been accumulating. Definitely not the best, but it is a solution.

## Part B

Learned about `defaultdict`, abused it. For each design, we know we can reach 0. Then, for each index we can start at, if the pattern matches a towel at that point, we add to the end index how many times we can reach the current index. Then we just have to total the number of ways we can reach the last index, and we're done. This part had a delta of 2 1/2 minutes, which I was very proud of. 

## Code

```python
from aocd.models import Puzzle
from collections import defaultdict

puzzle = Puzzle(day = 19, year = 2024)

data = puzzle.input_data

towels = set(data.split('\n\n')[0].split(', '))
designs = set(data.split('\n\n')[1].split('\n'))

def part_a():
    total = 0
    for design in designs:
        reachable:set[int] = set()
        L = len(design)
        to_check:set[int] = {0}
        while L not in reachable and len(to_check) > 0:
            idx = to_check.pop()
            if idx in reachable:
                continue
            reachable.add(idx)
            for towel in towels:
                towel_l = len(towel)
                if towel == design[idx:idx+towel_l]:
                    to_check.add(idx+towel_l)
        if L in reachable:
            total += 1
    print(total)
    puzzle.answer_a = total


def part_b():
    total = 0
    for design in designs:
        reachable:dict[int,int] = defaultdict(int)
        L = len(design)
        reachable[0] = 1
        for i in range(len(design)):
            for towel in towels:
                towel_l = len(towel)
                if towel == design[i:i+towel_l]:
                    reachable[i+towel_l] += reachable[i]
        total += reachable[L]
    print(total)
    puzzle.answer_b = total
