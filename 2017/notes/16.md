# AOC 2017 Day 16

## Part A

I had a *lot* of fun with this one. Initially, I used a list to do the dance. However, when I looked at Part B, I figured there may be a more interesting way to do it. It turns out that all three rules can be thought of as either left or right multiplying a matrix by a permutation matrix:
- The `s X` rule is just multiplying on the left by the matrix which shifts each row down and return sht elast row to the top, `X` times
- The `x X Y` rule is just multiplying on the left by the matrix that swaps rows `X` and `Y`
- The `p X Y` rule is multiplying on the right by the matrix that swaps columns `X` and `Y`. 

Using this knowledge, we multiply the identity matrix by the corresponding matrix on the corresponding side, then multiply that matrix by the character matrix. 

## Part B

This one was also very fun once I implemented the previous solution. The trick is to keep all of the left-multiplying operations as one matrix, the right-multiplying as another, raising both to the billionth power (raising to the thousand, raising that to the thousand, then raising that to the thousand), multiplying them together, then multiplying by the character array.

I was very prod of this solution, until I started looking at other solutions and seeing that people saw a cycle, which threw me off. 16!=20,922,789,888,000, which is greater than 1,000,000,000. Thus, the number of permutations of the 16 dancers is greater than the number of dances we do, so there's no guarantee there's a loop. My code doesn't assume a loop, but I guess there was :shrug:.
