# AOC 2017 Day 6

## Part A

So I just forgot that tuples in Python were hashable for sets, so I created a hash in base 56 (because doing the math with my input, that was the most that any one pile could possibly have). In addition, We only need the data for all but the last, as there is a fixed number of blocks. 

## Part B

Just had to add a dict to store where any hash was seen first. 

## Code
```python
from aocd.models import Puzzle

puzzle:Puzzle = Puzzle(day = 6, year = 2017)

def hash_a(pile):
    H = 0
    for (idx, val) in enumerate(pile[:-1:]):
        H += val * (56**idx)
    return(H)

def part_a():
    pile = [int(i) for i in puzzle.input_data.split()]
    curr_hash = hash_a(pile)
    seen_hashes = set()

    n = 0

    while not (curr_hash in seen_hashes):
        seen_hashes.add(curr_hash)
        size = max(pile)
        idx = pile.index(size)
        pile[idx] = 0
        for _ in range(size):
            idx = (idx+1) % len(pile)
            pile[idx] += 1
        n += 1
        curr_hash = hash_a(pile)
    puzzle.answer_a = n
    print(n)

def part_b():
    pile = [int(i) for i in puzzle.input_data.split()]
    curr_hash = hash_a(pile)
    seen_hashes = set()

    pos_dict = dict()

    n = 0

    while not (curr_hash in seen_hashes):
        seen_hashes.add(curr_hash)
        pos_dict[curr_hash] = n
        size = max(pile)
        idx = pile.index(size)
        pile[idx] = 0
        for _ in range(size):
            idx = (idx+1) % len(pile)
            pile[idx] += 1
        n += 1
        curr_hash = hash_a(pile)
    puzzle.answer_b = n - pos_dict[curr_hash]
    print(n - pos_dict[curr_hash])

part_a()
part_b()
