# AOC 2017 Day 7

## Part A

Gotta love doing tree depth stuff. Part A was easy enough, just had to find the one element on the left that wasn't on the right.

## Part B

This one was a little worse, and required a lot more methods. However, I really liked the outcome. We're recursively checking which weight appears only once. Once we only have one weight, we know that we need to change that node's weight to the target. 

## Code

```python
from aocd.models import Puzzle

puzzle:Puzzle = Puzzle(day = 7, year = 2017)

weights:dict[str,int] = dict()
targets:dict[str,set[str]] = dict()
cum_weights:dict[str,int] = dict()

lines = puzzle.input_data.split("\n")
rules = [line.split(" -> ") for line in lines]

all_targets = set()
sources = set()
for rule in rules:
    startData = rule[0].split()
    source = startData[0]
    val = int(startData[1][1:-1])
    weights[source] = val

    sources.add(source)
    if(len(rule) > 1):
        target_ata = rule[1].split(", ")
        targets[source] = set(target_ata)
        for target in target_ata:
            all_targets.add(target)
    else:
        targets[source] = set()

def get_total_weight(node):
    if node in cum_weights.keys():
        return cum_weights[node]
    total = weights[node]
    for child in targets[node]:
        total += get_total_weight(child)
    cum_weights[node] = total
    return total

def recursive_check(node, GOAL = None):
    children = targets[node]

    if len(children) == 0:
        return((node,GOAL))
    
    different_weights:dict[int,set[str]] = dict()
    for child in children:
        weight = get_total_weight(child)
        if not(weight in different_weights.keys()):
            different_weights[weight] = set()
        different_weights[weight].add(child)
    
    if len(different_weights.keys()) == 1:
        return((node,GOAL - cum_weights[node] + weights[node]))
    keys = list(different_weights.keys())
    key_1 = keys[0]
    key_2 = keys[1]
    if len(different_weights[key_1]) == 1:
        return recursive_check(node = different_weights[key_1].pop(),
                               GOAL = key_2)
    else:
        return recursive_check(node = different_weights[key_2].pop(),
                               GOAL = key_1)

def part_a():
    for source in sources:
        if not(source in all_targets):

            puzzle.answer_a = source
            print(source)
            return(source)
    
def part_b(root):
    goal = recursive_check(root)
    puzzle.answer_b = goal[0]
    print(goal)

root = part_a()
part_b(root)
