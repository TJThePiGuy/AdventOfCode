# AOC 2017 Day 9

## Part A

This one was kinda interesting. Determining whether we cancel or are in garbage was just using flags, and getting our score is just as simple as counting the number of nested curly braces we're in, which I used a stack to track.

## Part B

Just had to change where my counter was counting, which should be during garbage.

## Code

```python
from aocd.models import Puzzle

puzzle:Puzzle = Puzzle(day = 9, year = 2017)

def part_a():
    total_score = 0
    in_garbage = False
    cancel = False
    full_str = puzzle.input_data
    L = len(full_str)
    open_inds = list()
    for idx in range(L):
        if(cancel):
            cancel = False
            continue
        curr_char = full_str[idx]
        if(curr_char == "!"):
            cancel = True
        elif(curr_char == '>' and in_garbage):
            in_garbage = False
        elif(in_garbage):
            continue
        elif(curr_char == "<"):
            in_garbage = True
        elif(curr_char == "{"):
            open_inds.append(idx)
        elif(curr_char == "}"):
            total_score += len(open_inds)
            open_inds.pop()
    puzzle.answer_a = total_score
    print(total_score)

def part_b():
    char_count = 0
    in_garbage = False
    cancel = False
    full_str = puzzle.input_data
    L = len(full_str)
    open_inds = list()
    for idx in range(L):
        if(cancel):
            cancel = False
            continue
        curr_char = full_str[idx]
        if(curr_char == "!"):
            cancel = True
        elif(curr_char == '>' and in_garbage):
            in_garbage = False
        elif(in_garbage):
            char_count += 1
            continue
        elif(curr_char == "<"):
            in_garbage = True
        elif(curr_char == "{"):
            open_inds.append(idx)
        elif(curr_char == "}"):
            open_inds.pop()
    puzzle.answer_b = char_count
    print(char_count)


part_a()
part_b()
