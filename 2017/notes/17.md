# AOC 2017 Day 17

## Part A

This one, I just created the list as I went. It's not space-efficient, but for 2018 numbers, I wasn't too concerned. I just inserted the next value where I should be, then get the element of the first index, which will be the element exactly after 0. 

## Part B

Creating a list of 50,000,000 elements and inserting new elements would be extremely inefficient, so we only care if the element we're inserting will be at the front, or if `curr_pos` modulo the length is 0. Brute-forcing like this took 15 seconds to run, which isn't great, but for 50,000,000 elements, I'll take it. 

## Code
```python
from aocd.models import Puzzle
from tqdm import tqdm

puzzle = Puzzle(day=17, year = 2017)

def part_a():
    data = int(puzzle.input_data)
    curr_list = [0]
    curr_pos = 0
    for i in range(1,2018):
        curr_pos += data
        curr_pos %= i
        curr_list.insert(curr_pos, i)
        curr_pos += 1
        # print(curr_list)
    pass
    puzzle.answer_a = curr_list[curr_pos]
    print(curr_list[curr_pos])


def part_b():
    data = int(puzzle.input_data)
    curr_pos = 0
    front = 0
    for i in tqdm(range(1,50_000_001)):
        curr_pos += data
        curr_pos %= i
        if curr_pos==0:
            front = i
        curr_pos += 1
    puzzle.answer_b = front
    print(front)

part_a()
part_b()
