# AOC 2017 Day 15

## Part A

Honestly? This one wasn't bad to brute force. Sure, there may be a cycle early on, but my code ran in under 30 seconds to brute force, which I'd consider successful. Checking if the last 16 bits are equal to each other was as simple as checking if `a_val` and `b_val` were congruent modulo $2^{16}=65536$. 

## Part B

Also not too bad, just a while loop inside to get the next number. Brute forcing still ran in under 20 seconds. 

## Code

```python
from aocd.models import Puzzle
from tqdm import tqdm

puzzle = Puzzle(day=15, year = 2017)

def part_a():
    data = [int(i.split()[-1]) for i in puzzle.input_data.split('\n')]

    a_val = data[0]
    b_val = data[1]

    a_mult = 16807
    b_mult = 48271

    big_mod = 2147483647

    match_count = 0

    for i in tqdm(range(40_000_000)):
        a_val *= a_mult
        a_val %= big_mod

        b_val *= b_mult
        b_val %= big_mod

        match_count += ((a_val - b_val) % (1<<16)) == 0
    puzzle.answer_a = match_count
    print(match_count)

def part_b():
    data = [int(i.split()[-1]) for i in puzzle.input_data.split('\n')]

    a_val = data[0]
    b_val = data[1]

    a_mult = 16807
    b_mult = 48271

    big_mod = 2147483647

    match_count = 0

    for i in tqdm(range(5_000_000)):
        
        a_val *= a_mult
        a_val %= big_mod

        while(a_val % 4 != 0):
            a_val *= a_mult
            a_val %= big_mod

        b_val *= b_mult
        b_val %= big_mod

        while(b_val % 8 != 0):
            b_val *= b_mult
            b_val %= big_mod

        match_count += ((a_val - b_val) % (1<<16)) == 0
    puzzle.answer_b = match_count
    print(match_count)
