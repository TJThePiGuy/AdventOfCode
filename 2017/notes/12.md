# AOC 2017 Day 12

## Part A

Implemented sort of a "flood-fill" algorithm to determine how many different things were connected to 0. Generally, we just add neighbors to an undored list if they haven't been checked yet.

## Part B

This one I sped up by keeping a consistent `checked` set and iterating over every value. I know that if it is in `checked`, then it must have already been in something by itself, and so I skip over it. Otherwise, it's in a separate group, so increment the counter by 1. It's still the same flood-fill-esque algorithm.

## Code

```python
from aocd.models import Puzzle

puzzle:Puzzle = Puzzle(day = 12, year = 2017)

def part_a():
    data = puzzle.input_data.split('\n')
    # data = '0 <-> 2\n1 <-> 1\n2 <-> 0, 3, 4\n3 <-> 2, 4\n4 <-> 2, 3, 6\n5 <-> 6\n6 <-> 4, 5'.split('\n')
    lines = [_.split(' <-> ') for _ in data]
    connect_dict:dict[int,set[int]] = dict()

    for line in lines:
        source = int(line[0])
        targets = set(int(_) for _ in line[1].split(', '))
        connect_dict[source] = targets

    to_check:set[int] = set()
    to_check.add(0)
    checked:set[int] = set()

    connected:set[int] = set()

    while(len(to_check) != 0):
        val = to_check.pop()
        if(val in checked):
            continue
        connected.add(val)
        checked.add(val)
        for new_val in connect_dict[val]:
            if (new_val in checked):
                continue
            to_check.add(new_val)
    
    ans = len(connected)
